# AI-Health-care-Chatbot

This project is a machine learning-based diagnostic tool that predicts possible diseases based on user-provided
symptoms. By leveraging a decision tree classifier, the system can interactively ask the user about specific symptoms and
use their responses to predict a likely disease with a confidence level. This application provides a foundation for healthcare
chatbots and digital health assistants that offer preliminary diagnostic support.
